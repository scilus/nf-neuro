    section_name: "EDDY QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for EDDY correction, which is used to
      correct distortions and motion artifacts. The animation shows a
      before-and-after comparison of the correction. To assess the quality of
      the correction, focus on areas prone to distortions, such as the frontal
      lobe and the cerebellum/spinal cord region. Look for reduced geometric warping,
      improved alignment with anatomical boundaries, and correction of
      eddy-current-induced displacements. Additionally, ensure that no new
      artifacts or excessive blurring are introduced in the corrected images.

    section_name: "Topup QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for TOPUP correction, which is used to correct
      susceptibility-induced distortions by leveraging pairs of images acquired with
      opposite phase-encoding directions. The animation shows a before-and-after
      comparison of the correction. To assess the quality of the correction, focus
      on regions most affected by susceptibility distortions, such as the frontal lobe
      and the cerebellum/spinal cord area. Look for improved alignment of anatomical
      structures, reduced stretching or compression, and better symmetry between the
      corrected images. Additionally, ensure that the correction does not introduce
      new artifacts or excessive blurring.

    section_name: "Registration of anatomical image in DWI space QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the registration of the T1-weighted
      structural image to diffusion space, using the b0 image as a reference.
      This step ensures accurate alignment between structural and diffusion
      data. To assess the quality of the registration, check for good alignment
      of anatomical structures. Specifically, look for proper overlay of cortical
      and subcortical structures without excessive warping, stretching,
      or misalignment. Pay particular attention to boundaries such as the
      ventricles and major white matter tracts, ensuring they match well
      between the T1-weighted and b0 images. If misalignment is present,
      consider flagging this specific subject for further review.
