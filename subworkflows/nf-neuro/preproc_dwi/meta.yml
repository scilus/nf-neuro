description: |
  Subworkflow performing pre-processing of DWI image from from brain extraction to motion correction and resampling.
  It requires at least one input channels including a DWI image with corresponding b-value (bval) and b-vector (bvec) files (ch_dwi).
  The next 3 channels are optional and includes a reversed DWI image with correspond bval and bvec files (ch_rev_dwi),
  a reversed phase encoded b = 0 image (ch_rev_b0) and a channel for Topup configuration file.
    1) Required channel include the following main steps:
          Brain Extraction, Denoising, Eddy, N4 Bias Correction, Normalization, and Resampling.
    2) Required and optional channels include the following main steps:
          Brain Extraction, Denoising, Topup+Eddy, N4 Bias Correction, Normalization and Resampling.
  The resulting file from this subworkflows is a DWI that has been denoised, corrected for susceptibility,
  eddy currents and motion, normalized, cropped and resampled.
  The next step would be to extract diffusion profiles for the corrected DWI, using a module implementing either
  DTI (see RECONST_DTI), fODF (see RECONST_FODF) or MAP-MRI (NotImplementedYet).
  ---------  Steps  --------------------
  Brain Extraction (bet, FSL).
      Extract brain mask from the b0 image and applied to the whole DWI.
      This brain extraction is required to remove the skull and prepare the DWI to the T1 Registration.
  Denoising (dwidenoise, MPPCA method, MRtrix3).
      Used to remove the noise induced by the MRI acquisition,
      enhance the signal to noise ratio and improve the image quality and following metrics.
      The denoising is performed in the original spatial resolution and uses the MP-PCA method.
  Topup (FSL - optional).
      Topup uses the b=0 and reversed phase encoded b=0 images to extract the deformation field and
      corrects the brain deformation induced by the magnetic field susceptibility artefacts.
  Eddy (FSL).
      Eddy corrects eddy-currents, motion artefacts and performs slice-wise outlier detection and correction.
      When Topup is run, the eddy command is performed using the topup output.
  N4 Bias Correction (N4BiasFieldCorrection, ANTs).
      The N4 Bias Correction normalizes the image intensities and reduces this intensity bias
      (the center of the brain is less intense than its outer boundary due to multi-channel
      head coils). N4 correction is performed on the b=0 and applied to the whole DWI.
  Normalize (dwinormalise, MRtrix3).
      The DWI is normalized to have a mean value in the WM of approximately 1000.
      This task permits analyzing datasets from different MRI scanners with the same acquisition scheme.
  Resample (DIPY).
      The DWI is resampled to 1 mm isotropic spatial resolution, which is usually the spatial
      resolution of the T1. This spatial resolution is modifiable in the configuration file.
