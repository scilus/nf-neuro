name: "anatomical_segmentation"
description: |
  Subworkflow performing anatomical segmentation to produce WM, GM and CSF maps/masks. It handles
  two type of input channels, either an anatomical image (most likely T1) or freesurfer parcellations
  files. Depending on which channel is provided, the subworkflow will perform either of the following:
  1)  Channel with an anatomical image will result in using FSL's fast segmentation producing WM, GM,
      and CSF masks/maps.
  2)  Channel with FreeSurfer's parcellations files will result in using Scilpy's tools to produce
      WM, GM, and CSF masks (probability maps are not produced with this option).
  Typical next steps after this subworkflow would be to combine the resulting masks/maps with fODF
  data to perform TRACKING.

        The input channel containing the anatomical images (typically T1s). If provided, the
        subworkflow will perform segmentation using FSL's fast.

  - ch_freesurferseg:

      description: |
        The input channel containing freesurfer parcellations files (aparc+aseg and wm_parc
        parcellations). If provided, the subworkflow will use Scilpy's tools to convert the
        parcellations into masks.
