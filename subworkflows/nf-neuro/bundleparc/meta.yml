  BundleParc performs bundle segmentation and parcellation directly from fODFs
  for a specified number of points/segments/labels.

  Bundle definitions follow TractSeg's, without the whole corpus callosum.
  However it is still represented in 7 subparts which should be coherent
  between their parcellations.
